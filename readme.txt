Hi Folks,

    Hurray, I made that!!. Now you can interpret VBScript to extend the interfaces of your application. Allow your end users to extend your program using the power of Visual Basic. Hm.., I can't find any reason for these US Software companies not to provide me an H1 visa for me to join them :).

    My script engine, that works using Script Control gives you unlimited power, and takes VB to the next step. You can interpret VB from your own application. 

    Getting a little confused? Imagine this. Your end users can write VB code to extend your application interfaces. Simply like Microsoft uses VBA to extend Microsoft Office, you can now use VBScript to extend your program. This means that you can allow your users to develop custom scripting, and you can make programs that work on macros. Amazing, right?

    In this demo, I shows you how to add forms and class interfaces to the Script Control. Just run the application before even taking a look at the code. 

    One last word, VOTE FOR ME IF YOU FIND THIS USEFULL. Thanks

Regards,
